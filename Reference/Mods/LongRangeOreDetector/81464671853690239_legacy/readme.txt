Longer range Ore Detectors for both Large and Small grids are added, at 2x, 4x and 8x powers.

The only changed items are the range and build component counts, all artwork etc is unchanged.

Ore detectors have stupidly short range. This is annoying. This mod adds some higher power alternatives. Costs are "linear" in that, for 2x the detection range, 2x the detector components are required. Power consumption can't be modded (at least not without code mods) - at least from what I found [url=https://github.com/KeenSoftwareHouse/SpaceEngineers/blob/master/Sources/Sandbox.Game/Definitions/MyOreDetectorDefinition.cs]in the source.[/url]

Code is on [url=https://github.com/draeath/SpcEng_LR-OreDetect]github.[/url] While I haven't tagged a license, you're free to do whatever you like with this. You don't need to ask, you don't need to tell me.
