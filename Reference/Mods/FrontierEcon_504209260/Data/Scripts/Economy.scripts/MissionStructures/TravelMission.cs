    //or in the case of a chain mission we add / advance to the next part of the mission chain
    //the next chain could be generated to be different depending how the previous part was completed
    //MyAPIGateway.Utilities.GetObjectiveLine().Objectives.Add("Mission"); or 
    // if we need to switch to next mission in chain -  MyAPIGateway.Utilities.GetObjectiveLine().AdvanceObjective();
    //text of current objective useful for showmissionscreen string etc MyAPIGateway.Utilities.GetObjectiveLine().CurrentObjective
    //danger here is on mission chains - we need to reset the entire mission chain data and position in the hud - if we advance objective 
    //any subsequent new missions will be written to element 1 and we will still be on element 2 or 3 from the old mission.
    //I really need a lot more info on the inner workings of the mission system here..
    //either that or i avoid using advanceobjective entirely but that will mean we need missionID to be a 2 dimensional array, to track 
    //mission and chain position.. which sounds like a safer bet - but wastes memory since the mission system has an element variable already.
    //we could also use waypoints/gps points here which are removed as player investigates them for mission chains
    //if we ever implement vanity names/scan database trading this could be used to require a player to /scan a specific location too
    //Lana suggests fly a specific type of ship (large / small / spacesuit) too
